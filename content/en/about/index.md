 <p style='text-align: justify;'>
You can call me Chad. I’m a data scientist and software engineer with a strong background in computer science, programming, machine learning, and embedded system engineering. These days, I work remotely as a data scientist with "The Clinician"(The company behind the ZEDOC outcomes measurement platform.One of the leading provider of data and analytics technology and services to healthcare organizations), but this blog, its content, and opinions are my own. I blog about data science, technology, culture, gadgets, code, the web, where we’re going and where we’ve been. I’m excited about community, social equity, media, entrepreneurship, and above all, the open web.

I have a Master of Software Development and Bachelor of Electronics and Computer System Degree from Victoria University of Wellington.Also an Electrotechnology Diploma from Wellington Institute of technology. I have been selected as one of the best 25 engineering students in New Zealand by Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand (IPENZ) to take part in Engineering Leaders Today for Engineering Leaders Tomorrow conference in 2013.</p>

I believe the best way to change the world is in concentric circles: start with yourself and work your way out from there. If you get yourself sorted out, then that is one less person for the world to worry about. You’ll be in a position to contribute rather than consume. You will add order rather than disorder.</p>

I don’t merely write about things. Along the way, I like to try out the concepts for myself as I experiment with building better habits as an entrepreneur, programmer, and lifelong learner. In the end, my work ends up being one-part storytelling, one-part academic research, one-part personal experiment. It’s a colourful blend of inspirational stories, academic science, hard-earned wisdom.</p>


I don’t claim to have all the answers and I still have a lot to learn,but I’m happy to share what I’ve learned along the way.If you just want to email me, go ahead flick me message via contact me page.but be nice and make sure you Googled around a bit before you do..</p>
